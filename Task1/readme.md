## 🌐 UiPath Assistant – Weather & Movie Info Automation

This UiPath project allows the user to choose between two smart assistant robots:

- ✅ Weather Assistant:
     - Takes a country name → searches for weather on web → writes results in Notepad → saves the file automatically.
  
- ✅ Movie Assistant:
    - Takes a movie name → searches the movie on IMDb → extracts details like Year, Rating, Genre, Description → saves them into Notepad.
